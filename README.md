- Dependencies outlined in requirements.txt

-------

**Instructions:**
- Download/install Python 3.7+ if not done already;

- Run setup.bat to install dependencies or 
    ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
    from the project directory
    
    If you run setup.bat, the bot will launch itself as well once dependencies are installed.
